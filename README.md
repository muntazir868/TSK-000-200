## Video Object Detection
 Utilize computer vision techniques to detect and track objects in videos.
 Use pre-trained object detection models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or
Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks).
 Process video frames and extract objects by predicting their bounding boxes and
labels.
 Apply post-processing techniques to improve accuracy and handle object
tracking across frames.
